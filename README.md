# FRMIS:Fast and Robust Microscopic Image Stitching

FRMIS is fast and robust automatic stitching algorithm to generate a consistent whole-slide image. This algorithm utilizes dominant SURF features from a small part of the overlapping region to achieve pairwise registration and take into account the number of matched features in the global alignment.

All codes were implemented using Matlab
