# FRMIS: Fast and Robust Microscopic Image Stitching

FRMIS is fast and robust automatic stitching algorithm to generate a consistent whole-slide image. This algorithm utilizes dominant SURF features from a small part of the overlapping region to achieve pairwise registration and take into account the number of matched features in the global alignment.

This repository contains source code. All codes were implemented using Matlab.

FRMIS is designed to stitch 2D image from different image modalities, including bright-field, phase-contrast, and fluorescence.
